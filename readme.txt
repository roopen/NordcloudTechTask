HOW TO RUN

IN EDITOR

Requirements
.NET 7.0 runtime
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0
Pick either .NET Runtime 7 or SDK 7 and install the appropriate version for your operating system.

Opening with an IDE
Open NordcloudTechTask.sln with Visual Studio or Visual Code and select NordcloudTechTask.Console as your startup project and run.

IN COMMAND LINE
Download the ready-made .exe from releases (https://github.com/roopen/NordcloudTechTask/releases/download/1.0.0-WIN64/NordcloudTechTask.Console.exe) and run that. If you want to build binaries yourself (for instance because you are on Linux) you have to do so by opening the project with an IDE.
